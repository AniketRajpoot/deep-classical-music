# Deep-Classical-Music

This project focuses on exploring methods to generate Indian Classical music without lossing its original attributes. Currently we have explored unconditional and conditional generation using Jukebox methodoloy. This repo contains the training code for the same. In future, we will add more methods because with the dawn of Generative AI, new methods for audio generation are researched and implemented day by day.  

## TODO 
- [x] Upload the colab notebook for inference of Jukebox model 
- [ ] Upload relevant links to dataset and checkpoints
- [ ] Upload the colab notebook for training of VQ-VAE and Upsamplers which make up the Jukebox model
- [ ] Make the code modular and train on more hardware
- [ ] Explore other methods for audio generation

## Inference  

Uploaded inference.ipynb for generating samples in two ways : 
- Ancestral Sampling 
- Primed Sampling
